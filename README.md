Description:
In this project you will color objects based on the shading model
we discussed in class.


Procedure:
I had a very hard time with this project. We must first completely understand the mathematical equations
that Dr. Palmer had provided us with. Once we've conceptually understood, we had to utilize them and implement them within our code.
At first, I simply continued to work on my parser to be able to handle all of the new contents of the JSON file.
That part was not difficult. When I began needing to creating these inline functions for vector math. I used this website: http://csis.pace.edu/~marchese/CG_Rev/Lect10New/cg_l10new.htm
to further help me get clarity. I had a lot of help from other classmates on certain mistakes I kept running into. For example, I simply could not figure how to create both the,
AngularAttenuation() and RadialAttenuation() functions. In conclusion, this was by far the hardest project I've done yet. As you will see, this is still not finished. As you will see,
sphere looks spotty. I'm not quite sure if that is a memory leak or not.
